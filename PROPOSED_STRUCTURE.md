## Key Changes from Current Structure:

1. **Broader Scope**: Not HR-centric, but People Data as universal concept
2. **Technical Depth**: O'Reilly style with proper computer science foundations
3. **Modern Topics**: MCP, Guardrails, Privacy-Preserving ML prominent
4. **Production Focus**: Real system architecture, not just prototypes
5. **Multiple Domains**: HR as one chapter, alongside Product, Enterprise Intelligence
6. **Professional Tone**: No emojis, formal technical writing
7. **Structured Learning**: Progressive complexity, proper chapter flow

## Questions for You:

1. Does this structure align with your vision?
2. Should we emphasize certain areas more (e.g., MCP, Product, Guardrails)?
3. What's your preferred starting point for the rewrite?
4. Do you want to keep any existing content, or start fresh?
5. Target length per chapter?
6. Code examples in Python only, or multiple languages?

**Next Steps**: 
Once you approve this structure, I'll await your guidance to rewrite each section systematically, maintaining your control over content and direction.
